## Examples Done for Testing and Evaluation

- I've set up set of functions with different colours depending on field value for rating and annual revenue to change highlight colour
- function for red highlight Phone field when it's empty
- simply changed name from Rating to Starring

All works great.

## Use

In my opinion, apart from the fact that it can slightly slower your page, it's a great app and can be really useful in all kinds of orgs.  
Though, I would rather use Indicators as they are not as "shouty". They do show what is important / missing and do not impact the layout as much.
Specially that the end users will probably not be able to set up their own functions to use highlighter and will be left with functions set up by admin.
I think Indicators are much more user friendly from the "viewer/user" perspective.
