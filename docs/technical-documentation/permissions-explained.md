## Salesforce Permissions Needed

* To create [Custom Metadata Records](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.custommetadatatypes_ui_populate.htm&type=5), users need the *Customize Application* permission. 
  * See the [Customize Application](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000386451&type=1) help document.
  * Customize Application is part of the System Administrator profile.
  * Be careful giving this permission to any other users.

## Salesforce Indicators Permission Set

* Assign the *Indicators Setup Access* permission set to any System Administrators who will be setting up SalesforceIndicators.
  * This grants access to the *Indicators Setup* Tab.

## User Permissions

* Assign the *Indicators User Access* permission set to any users who will be viewing Salesforce Indicators.
* This gives the user the access to the Apex Class that returns the data to the *Indicator Bundle* and *Indicator Item*. 
* Once the Indicator Bundle is added to the Lightning page, all users who can see that page can see the bundle, unless it is hidden by [Component Visibility](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.lightning_page_components_visibility.htm&type=5). 
* Users will only see the *Indicator Items* if they have read access to the field and sObject the [Indicator Item](../../setup-salesforce-indicators/indicator-item) is based on. 
* Test your *Indicator Bundles* to ensure that there are no blank bundles, which doesn't look good for users. 

## About Custom Metadata 
* See this [Trailhead Module](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/custom_metadata_types_dec) to learn more about Custom Metadata in Salesforce.
