## Brag Book

We have to celebrate our achievements. These are just some that We've heard of so far. 

* A previous client rang Jodie out of the blue and said "hey you know that indicator panel we had in our org at X company, can I have it in my new company's org".
* A random phone call on Jodie's business number and an older gentleman says "is that The Detail Department"? I say "yes?" he says "I just saw your YouTube video and I want you to install Salesforce Indicators in my Salesforce org". 
* An Admin after using Salesforce Indicators for the first time "Oh I just get it now!".
* A private message on a Zoom Webinar about a completely unrelated topic "I just installed your Salesforce Indicators component in my Sandbox and I will be using it in my demo this week. It is really neat and fills a much needed void in the product". How cool! 
* Jodie's client explaining a new feature to a user who had just come back from holidays "Oh and there are these icons on the right hand that display when the data gets to the external system and then it another icon appears when the external system updates Salesforce to say it's done, so you just have to look at the icons". It is really cool when the users take ownership of the Indicators and they can immediately see how the icons displaying and changing based on the record changing, can help.
