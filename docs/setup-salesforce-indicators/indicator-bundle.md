## Indicator Bundle Tips

**💡Setup Tips**

* When adding the Indicator Bundle to the Lightning Record Page, check the *Show Refresh Button* Checkbox. That way, as you are building your Indicators, you can quickly refresh the Bundle to see how the changes to the settings will appear on your page. 

**💡Design Tips**

* Titles and Icons are not required on Bundles, but they look best when the Large Icons are shown. a Bundle of small Icons used in a strip (see Examples) can look good with no Title and Icon. 
* If in doubt, just use the standard icon matching that record (eg `standard:account`)
* Don't use too many colors or icon styles. Try to stick with the [SLDS color pallette](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/){:target="_blank"}
* See [Additional Complementary Apps and Components to Enhance Your Org](../other-apps)
